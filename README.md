# My Commands
I wanted to make my own commands to do some automation. For example, I wanted to end some opened background tasks faster, so I wrote the code for that.</br>

# How Does It Work
First of all, you have to copy MyCommands File somewhere (the inner folder which contains "data" folder).</br>
Then, you have add this folder to your system's path. If you want to know how to do that, read the "HOWTO.txt" file.</br>
After that, if you use windows, you have add ".PY" to the systems extensions too (You can read the "HOWTO.txt" file for that too)</br>
But if you use linux, you have to 1. remove all the ".py"s from files, and 2. open terminal, navigate to this folder, then type:</br>
    $ chmod +x *.py</br>

# Last Words
I only have worked with windows and linux only. Some of the programs use terminal commands. So I limited them to windows and linux. If you use other operating systems, you have to edit the file yourself.</br>
